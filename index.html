   <p>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, and they're one of the most unique-looking animals, too. With their characteristic long noses, or trunks; large, floppy ears; and wide, thick legs, there is no other animal with a similar physique.vory, which comes from elephant tusks, is considered very valuable.

Tens of thousands of elephants are killed each year for their tusks, and as a result, elephant populations have declined rapidly.</p>
